# Activity Instructions

## Break Out Activity #1

- In `App.js`, create a callback function that toggles between 
`<PaintingForm />` / `<PaintingsList />` upon each click of `“Toggle Painting Form”`.

- Be sure to use the `formView` state in your solution!

## Break Out Activity #2

- Implement an `onClick` behavior to add votes for each Painting.

- In `Painting.js`, create a function to add votes (`addVotes()`) along with the 
necessary `onClick` logic.
